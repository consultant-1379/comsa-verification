Prepare a target specific install SDP
=====================================

Unpack the DEPLOYMENT TEMPLATE container (and since you are reading
this file you probably have done that already). 

The ERIC-JAVACAF-I-TEMPLATE-CXP9013050_4-R1A03 contains a campaign SDP
that installs JavaCaf on the System Controllers and a script to generate
a campaign SDP for any cluster size.

 ./generatecampaign generate ERIC-JAVACAF-I-TEMPLATE-CXP9013050_4-R1A03.sdp [SC=1] [PL=#]

The "SC=1" parameter must only be used for single-node clusters.
For example;

 ./generatecampaign generate ERIC-JAVACAF-I-TEMPLATE-CXP9013050_4-R1A03.sdp PL=8

for a 10 node cluster. A target specific SDP is generated;

 ERIC-JAVACAF-I-CXP9013050_4-R1A03_SCx2_PLx8.sdp


Import and execute the install campaign
=======================================

The campaign SDP prepared in the previos step is imported and
