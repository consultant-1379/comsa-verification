The *.emx model files in this directory are for several model projects used for generating test XML files for testing.

All were tested with DX ET 2.10.0 

  ECIM Feature	2.10.0.201403211350	com.ericsson.ecim.feature.feature.group
  
To generate XML files with any of the projects:

1). Create an empty model pro ject with the DX ET Tool.
2). Inport all the EMX files from the specific subdirectory.
3). generate XML files.

For the 'noRootClass' project there are two variants - normal model and invalid model (for negative test cases).
For the normal model use the 3 XML files in the 'noRootClass' subdirectory. For the invalid model replace the NoRootClass.emx file
with the one from the 'ivalid' subdirectory.
